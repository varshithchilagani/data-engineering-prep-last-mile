# Day 1 â€“ Data Engineering Prep Journey

As part of my final-mile preparation for data engineering roles, I'm documenting each day of focused learning and practice. This repository serves as a personal knowledge log and revision toolkit.

## What I Did Today:

Today, I watched the 3-hour **Data Engineering Masterclass by Darshil Parmar** on YouTube. My aim was to solidify core concepts and refresh my understanding of real-world data engineering workflows.

## What I Learned:

Here are some of the key concepts I noted from the session:

- What data engineers do in companies (ETL, big data tools, data architecture)
- Common data sources (APIs, RDBMS, logs, IOT)
- Data transformation basics (date formats, null handling, column merges)
- OLTP vs OLAP â€“ differences in purpose and technology
- Data modeling: fact vs dimension tables, and SCD types (1, 2, 3, 6)
- Role of data marts and data lakes in modern data pipelines
- High-level view of building data architecture with business-first thinking

I have noted many points, and I made them available in the `notes.md` file in this folder.
